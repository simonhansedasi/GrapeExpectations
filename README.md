## Project Goal

- Use **machine learning** to predict seasonal NDVI integrals for vineyard plots  
- Understand which **weather variables and plot features** drive vegetation growth  
- Provide **early insights into vine vigor and productivity**

### NDVI and NDVI Integral
The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) is a measure of vegetation health derived from satellite or aerial imagery. It captures how much light plants absorb versus reflect, giving a proxy for vigor and canopy density.

The NDVI integral sums NDVI over the growing season, effectively measuring total vegetation activity. In viticulture, this is crucial because:

It reflects overall vine growth and leaf area development

It correlates with canopy size, photosynthetic activity, and potential yield

Early-season NDVI integrals can guide management decisions, like irrigation, pruning, and harvest timing

By predicting NDVI integrals from weather and plot features, we can provide early insights into vine health and vineyard productivity, enabling more informed and timely interventions.
